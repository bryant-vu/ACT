<h2>About</h2>
  <p class='font-weight-light'><font size='4'>I've been tutoring since college about half a decade ago. I'm currently a data analyst and hobbyist level coder -- this website is a pet project of mine. It's just <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryant-vu'>me</a> working on it for now but hopefully the site grows into a one stop shop for anyone looking to improve their ACT scores.</font></p>

<h2>Want to help?</h2>

The source code is on <a href='https://www.github.com/bryant-vu/act'>GitHub</a> if you want to improve it. Otherwise, please <a href='/api/v1/donate'>donate</a>!
