Suppose that equally spaced dots are marked on each side of a regular polygon, with a dot at each vertex, and that the distance between consecutive dots is the same for all sides. The figure below shows 4 equally spaced dots per side, including a dot at each vertex, for an equilateral triangle. Which of the following expressions represents the number of dots for a regular polygon with n equally spaced dots including one at each vertex, marked on each of its s sides?",ns,ns - 1,ns - s,ns + s,ns – n,C (Topic: Plug in Numbers (Calc)),,,
